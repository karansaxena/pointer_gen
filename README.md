# Pointer Generator Model

This repository contains modified code for the ACL 2017 paper *[Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04368)*. For an intuitive overview of the original paper, read the [blog post](http://www.abigailsee.com/2017/04/16/taming-rnns-for-better-summarization.html).  For a beautiful documentation of how to run the original model, please refer to the [code for the paper](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator). The Python 3 version of the code that inspired this repo can be found [here](https://github.com/becxer/pointer-generator/).
