# Pointer Generator Model

This repository contains modified code for the ACL 2017 paper *[Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04368)*. For an intuitive overview of the original paper, read the [blog post](http://www.abigailsee.com/2017/04/16/taming-rnns-for-better-summarization.html).  For a beautiful documentation of how to run the original model, please refer to the [code for the paper](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator). The Python 3 version of the code that inspired this repo can be found [here](https://github.com/becxer/pointer-generator/).

### What's in it for me?

The goal of this repo is to serve as a tutorial for people just starting out with deep learning.  It is certainly not exhaustive, but it's how I learned some TensorFlow. 

You'll certainly get the most out of this notebook if you have some prior coding experience and know a bit of deep learning theory.  It goes step by step about what papers I read and how I ended up understanding this model's ins and outs.  Not only that, but also be able to tweak the model to explore your own ideas. If you have feedback or other ways you'd like to alter the model but don't know how to, please add your idea to the *Issues* handle and I'll address it at some point!
